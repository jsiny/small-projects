# CSS Challenge - Semantic HTML

This project is entirely made with **semantic HTML** (no pesky `div` or `span` were allowed here). For some additional challenge, I've only used **one** `class` and no `id` at all.

These constraints were meant to push me to think creatively. As such, I've resorted to using CSS pseudo-classes (eg. `tbody:first-of-type`) and CSS combinators (eg. `header + table`).

My goal here was to replicate this FDA Nutrition Facts Label (for Macaroni & Cheese):

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jsiny/small-projects/tree/master/screenshots/original_label.jpg" width="600" />
</p>

And here's my version:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jsiny/small-projects/tree/master/screenshots/my_label.png" width="600" />
</p>

Feel free to inspect [my CSS file](https://github.com/jsiny/small-projects/tree/master/nutrition_facts/nutrition_facts.css)!

*Sidenote:* I've chosen not to download any new font. My goal was not pixel perfection but rather to re-create a similar label with comparable aspect.
