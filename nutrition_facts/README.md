# CSS Challenge - Semantic HTML

This project is entirely made with **semantic HTML** (no pesky `div` or `span` were allowed here). For some additional challenge, I've only used **one** `class` and no `id` at all.

These constraints were meant to push me to think creatively. As such, I've resorted to using CSS pseudo-classes (eg. `tbody:first-of-type`) and CSS combinators (eg. `header + table`).

My goal here was to replicate this FDA Nutrition Facts Label (for Macaroni & Cheese):

And here's my version:

*Sidenote:* I've chosen not to download any new font. My goal was not pixel perfection but rather to re-create a similar label with comparable aspect.
